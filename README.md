## 🍽️ Food Order System Built in Python! 🚀

A Food Order System developed using Python! 🐍 This system is designed to streamline the process of ordering food with user-friendly features.

🔑 Key Features:
✅ View Menu – Browse through the available dishes with prices
✅ Place Order – Select items and customize quantities
✅ Order Summary – Display the ordered items and total cost
✅ Checkout – Calculate the final bill, including tax and discounts (if applicable)

🛠️ Technology Used:
🔹 Python for backend logic
🔹 Lists, dictionaries, and functions to manage menu and orders

🌟 Why I Built This:
This project was an exciting way to dive deeper into Python, improve my logical thinking, and simulate the functionality of a real-world food ordering application. It also gave me insights into how businesses manage menus and orders efficiently.

💡 Future Enhancements:
🔹 Add a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter or PyQt
🔹 Connect to a database to manage menus and order history
🔹 Introduce delivery tracking or payment gateway integration

📂 Code and Demo:
If you’re interested in the code or want to know more about the logic behind it, feel free to connect! I’d love to hear your thoughts and feedback. 😊
